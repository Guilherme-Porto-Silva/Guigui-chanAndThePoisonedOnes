Though not doing the same when walking on ground, it has shon tendency to bite humans who touch the trees they are on, that way injecting a very enigmatic substance, responsible for turning the victims into the next entity of the list.

                        Over the corse of a week or so, poison from these ants turn pale the human skin, makes their hair look like coal made cabels and their eyes assume the color of blood, and shine, due to a chamical reaction between the poison and the proteins responsible for the volotile flys. Those who have alrery lost their minds due to the poison now lurk trough the shadows of empty roads and dark rooms, hidding during day time to sleep. When seeing a human, they are going to follow them from a far. If the followed has yet not seen the entitys, they are going to tell them frases along the line of "How? How am I not about to be atacked by something that jumps from the shadows?" and "I is not possible, I can't be alone in this place..." with a misterius voice that apears to be coming from the had of the listener themself, with people usually not even considerating the possibility of an exterior source. If a person sees one of those entitys, last stop using this etherial voice, proceding to scare first by lurking right at the edges of their view field, usually in dark areas. Many people become wreches because the fear of those lurkers prevents them from sleeping, and, in some cases, even from drinking the almond water they could get from the fountains and randomly placed bottles that are around this level by scarering them away from those things. It is not known if the poison prevents the wreched cicle and provides hunger and thursty imunity or if evry person it turns into a scary ghost is doomed to become a wrech as well as all the victims they scared, but sights of them eating dead people and entitys have been reported to M.E.G..

                        Major Explorer Group estimates 10% to be the amount of tables found in this level's classrooms that have those eye drowings made with sisors on them. Should those be aprouched, orange light comes out of those drowings' pupils, as well as a high and anoing sound. If that who aprouched the table does not run away at this point, the eye blasts a powerfull wind wave on their direction, removing a centimiter from the celing's material upon full doging.
